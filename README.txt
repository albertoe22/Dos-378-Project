This project is for CECS 378 class Introduction to Computer Security Principles.
Our group members are Albert Truong, David Kwon, Richard Lu, Richard Pho, and Stephen Long.

We will be writing our code in python (scapy), in which we are going to create packets to simulate
a DOS attack under teacher supervision.
